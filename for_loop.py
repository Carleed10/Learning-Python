# Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and uses a loop to calculate

# Input: 1234
# Output: 10 (1+2+3+4)


# numbers = input("Enter digits of your choice ")
# total = 0

# for number in numbers:
#     total += int(number)

# print(f"The sum of numbers is: {total}")

# for state in states:
#     if "a" in state:
